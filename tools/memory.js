    'USE `latest` FOR ANY STATE QUESTION — "did X finish", "what happened after Y", "where did we ' +

    're-parse had finished, got the exchange where the work STARTED at score 0.88, saw no completion ' +
    'ranked above it, and reported the answer unknowable — the answer was one term-filter away. ' +
    'Read its `orderedBy`, `scopeHint` and `termWarning`; a zero from an AND-filter usually means one ' +
    'term nobody uses, and the response names it. ' +

    'QUERY `latest` WITH IDENTIFIERS, NOT PROSE — it is a literal string filter, so a commit SHA, ' +
    'file name, flag, function name, error string or exact number finds what a natural-language ' +
    'phrasing cannot. Measured over six real questions: "pushed commit with failing test semicolon" ' +
    'returned nothing and "high RAM usage cause overnight run" returned a coincidental match, while ' +

    'A search result\'s `modified` is THE FILE\'S MTIME AT INDEX TIME, never a live read — only ' +
    'get returns a live stat (as `liveModified`). `serverVersion` / `serverStartedAt` identify the running process: ' +
    'a long-lived MCP process keeps the code it was spawned with, so an old SHA there means the client needs a restart. ' +
    'The corpus also includes institutional HANDOFF DOCUMENTS (type: "handoff-doc") indexed READ-ONLY from outside the ' +
    'memory folders; no action can write, demote or delete one. ' +
    'Memories written from OTHER projects (~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory) are curated content too: they live in ' +

    'demoted or promoted. A default-scope search widens to every corpus automatically when another project has memories, ' +
