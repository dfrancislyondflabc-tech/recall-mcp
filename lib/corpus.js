// ---- REAL FACT-TIME (Phase 2a) ----------------------------------------------
// `modified` was a lie for 110 of 140 curated files: the 2026-08-19 account
// backfill rewrote every mtime in one pass, so "newest first" ordered by
// bookkeeping. The fix is an EXPLICIT stamp — metadata.modified, the exact key
// loadCorpus already prefers over mtime — written by the Stop hook when a file
// changes, and once by a git-floor backfill for the pre-hook era.
//
// FRONTMATTER-ONLY SURGERY, the setTier discipline: the body is never touched,
// split, or reordered, so the incremental indexer's body-keyed vector reuse
// holds (test a19 pins that a frontmatter edit does not re-embed). A file with
// NO frontmatter is REFUSED rather than given one: the only such file is
// MEMORY.md, which is loaded verbatim into Claude's context every session — a
// YAML block prepended there would be prompt pollution, not metadata.
//
// `modifiedSource` records what kind of claim the date is: 'stop-hook' = the
// commit that carried the change (real fact-time from here on); 'git-floor' =
// the newest memory-repo commit touching the file (a floor, not fact-time —
// the repo only exists since 2026-08-23). Never inferred from body text.
