// lib/section-docs.js — PHASE B: a section is a document.
//
// THE PROBLEM, MEASURED. `email-backup-changelog` is 635 KB of ~40 version
// entries; `zip-build-checklist` is 100 KB across 21 sections. Retrieval returns
// the whole thing or nothing, and the useful unit is always ONE section: "the
// Gate #24 section", "the v112 entry". Worse, `RETRIEVAL.longDoc` deliberately
// penalises a document by its chunk count -- the correct fix for a 517-chunk
// document winning on the MAXIMUM over its chunks -- which means the checklist
// cannot win a query about its own content. Measured before this file existed:
//
//   search("release completeness receipt") -> a deck memory, a retrieval memory,
//   dom-pilot..., zip-v110-shipped, dom-pilot-api...   (the checklist: absent)
//
// Penalise the document, promote the SECTION. Those are complementary, not
// contradictory, but they have to be calibrated together, which is why this is
// behind a flag and gated on measurement.
//
// 🟥 WHY A FLAG. Adding children changes the corpus POPULATION, and per-corpus
// statistics here are load-bearing: `loadScope` derives `referenceChunks` from
// the corpus, and blending populations has cost recall twice by measurement
// (staging into curated: MRR 0.826 -> 0.681). Splitting every eligible curated
// document takes that corpus from 148 docs to 413 (+179%). That is not a change
// anyone should ship on the strength of it sounding right.
//
// SCOPE. Only documents that are BOTH large AND genuinely sectioned. A 104 KB
// document with zero `##` headings (example-bot) gains nothing from being
// "split" into one child that is itself, and an exchange's headings are whatever
// someone happened to type in a chat reply, not a structure.

// Five of twelve pre-registered questions miss on WRONG DOCUMENT, and the theory
// was that a child had nothing to match on but a few ordinary heading words
// ("AFTER GREEN", "What NOT to do"). Swept on the real index path:
//
//   prose chars   sections   recall   MRR
//   0 (control)     7/12       9/10   0.800
//   120             7/12       9/10   0.800

//   300             6/12       9/10   0.800
//
// Identical up to 200 and WORSE beyond -- `description` is the 2.0-weighted
// field, so lengthening it dilutes the heading through BM25 length
// normalisation. 120 is kept purely because the description is what a caller
// READS in a result list, and "zip-build-checklist — AFTER GREEN — record + tag
// — Tag both platforms at the ship SHA…" tells them more than the heading alone.
// No retrieval claim is made for it.

//
// Baseline 0/12 understates it: only 4 of the 12 returned even the PARENT, so
// eight ordinary questions about the build checklist and the diagnostic guides
// retrieved nothing useful at all. Recall goes UP, because a 654 KB changelog
// and a 100 KB checklist stop distorting the corpus statistics that the absence
// guard reads. The changelog now appears on 4 of 32 probes, every one a real
// keyword match (kw 0.25-0.82) -- NOT the kw=0 max-over-chunks artefact, which
// stays at zero.
//
// 🟥 What made it work was NOT the long-document penalty this was meant to need.
// beta and the child waiver barely move the result across the whole grid. The
// binding constraint was IDF counting index ROWS -- see the docFile note in
// lib/bm25.js -- and the build crash was children inheriting their parent's
// hash into a reuse map keyed by file. Neither was the thing I predicted.
