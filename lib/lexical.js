// lib/lexical.js — the phrase leg: where in a body do the query's words sit
// TOGETHER, and how tightly.
//
// BM25 with the body in it (v1.1) knows a document contains every word of a
// quoted sentence. It cannot know they occur in that order, in one breath,
// rather than scattered across 600 KB — and that difference IS the difference
// between the sentence you quoted and a document that happens to use the same
// vocabulary. The 616 KB changelog contains almost every word in the corpus;
// what it does not contain is most of the corpus's SENTENCES.
//
// So: find the tightest window of body tokens covering the most distinct query
// terms, score it by coverage and density, and cut the snippet from it. One
// mechanism answers "is this the quoted line?" and "which line is it?" at once.
//
// Cost control: this runs over the RERANK SET only (the top few dozen fused
// candidates), never the whole corpus, and every document's positional token
// array is built once and cached on the loaded index entry.
