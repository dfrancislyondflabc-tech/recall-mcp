//
// v1.1: the body is in. Before, the keyword leg saw only the human-written
// summary fields, so a distinctive phrase living in a body paragraph — the
// thing `grep` is best in the world at — had to be recovered by the dense leg,
// which is structurally the wrong tool for a literal string. That cost the
// benchmark's V1 and V6 outright.
//
// Field weighting is done by weighting term frequencies, not by repeating text,
// so document length stays honest — and now that the body is included, that
// honesty does real work: BM25's own length normalisation is what stops a
// 616 KB changelog from matching everything (see RETRIEVAL.fieldWeights.body).

 * BM25F — three field groups, each length-normalised against its OWN average.

 *
 * v1.0 lumped name + description + headings into one group normalised by their
 * combined length. That was survivable while the group was small, but it hides
 * a real bug that adding the body brings into the open: heading count scales
 * with document size, so in a long document the TITLE gets normalised by the
 * length of 263 headings it has nothing to do with.
 *
 * Measured: `email-backup-changelog` has 263 headings, giving it a lumped
 * summary length of 6,310 against a corpus average of 277. Its own name scored
 * 3.30 raw on the query "email backup app changelog" — behind five documents
 * that merely mention the words. It was literally unreachable by its own title,
 * in v1.0 too; nobody noticed because the dense leg's chunk-count advantage was
 * handing it a top-3 slot on 21 of 32 probes anyway. Take that away (see
 * RETRIEVAL.longDoc) and the flaw is load-bearing.
 *
 *   title    name + description  — bounded-length, human-authored labels
 *   headings the heading list    — grows with the document
 *   body     the text            — grows with the document
 *
 * Field weights are folded into tf at accumulation time, so a name hit is worth
 * ten body hits before saturation. Setting fieldWeights.body to 0 leaves the
 * keyword leg reading exactly the fields v1.0 read, which is what makes this
 * change bisectable.
