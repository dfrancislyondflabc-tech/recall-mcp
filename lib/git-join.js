// THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. The corpus records what conversations SAID. Asking it
// "was this resolved?" means classifying language, and language has failed here
// three times: a correction vocabulary that fired on 76% of exchanges, an
// unresolved-statement vocabulary that fired on 24%, and a compaction-summary
// exclusion that sounded right and measured worse. Every one of those tried to
// infer, from words, something that has a hard record elsewhere.
//
// For engineering work that record is git. "I committed the fix" is not a sentence
// to be classified — it names a SHA, and a SHA either exists in the repository or
// it does not, either landed on the mainline or did not, on a date, touching files.
// Verification instead of inference: it cannot cry wolf, it cannot drift, and it
// needs no model.

// MEASURED COVERAGE (2026-08-23, 2,319 ingested exchanges): 404 (17%) name at least
// one hex token that is a REAL commit — 330 in the Email Backup repo, 25 in this
// one. 707 hex-shaped candidates collapse to 355 real commits, so the shape alone
// means nothing and every token is checked.
//
// REPOS ARE CONFIGURED, NEVER INFERRED. An earlier draft planned to count commits
// "in this repo", meaning wherever the script happened to run — the memory server —
// while the corpus is about the Email Backup codebase. That would have produced a
// confident number about the wrong project, exactly the silent-wrong-answer class
// this module exists to remove. Unconfigured, it returns nothing rather than guess.
