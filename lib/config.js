// ---- WHERE ANOTHER PROJECT'S MEMORIES GO ----------------------------------
// They are CURATED-TYPE content — hand-written rules, project notes and
// feedback, the same register and the same authorship as the canonical folder's.
// Until 2026-08-20 they were routed into STAGING by `primary: false`, which
// ranked them as though they were raw conversation exchanges: archive-tier
// semantics, no hot boost, and unreachable at the default scope. A standing rule
// written from another project would have ranked below transcript chatter.
//
// THEY GET THEIR OWN INDEX, and that was MEASURED the same way the handoff
// corpus was (scripts/bench-probes.js, 16-document fixture second project under
// test/fixtures/projects/, routed into the curated index):
//
//   metric                    curated-only   +15 other-project memories inside
//                                            the curated index
//   MRR (24 ranked probes)       0.8125                 0.7917
//   probes in top-3              22/24                  22/24
//   absence verdict               4/4                    4/4
//   P2 (paraphrase)              rank 1        rank 2, behind a fixture document
//   every other probe's score      —      moved, -2.3% to +6.3%, content unchanged
//
// TWO separate damages, and they are worth telling apart.
//
// SHARED STATISTICS is the one that generalises. Not a single curated document
// changed, and every single probe's top score moved — V2 +5.1%, E9 +4.2%, N2
// -2.3%. Fifteen documents joining a 122-document corpus move BM25's average
// document length and every idf, so queryIdealScore moves, so `absoluteKeyword`
// scales differently, so the fused score of every memory changes. That is the
// same mechanism that cost the handoff experiment an absence verdict (X4, on a
// 0.0042 margin). Here it did not cross a floor. Next month, with a different
// corpus, there is nothing to say it would not.
//
// COMPETITION is the one that is specific and vivid: P2 asks what to run after
// editing the huge single-page web file, and a memory from ANOTHER project took
// rank 1 from this project's standing rule. Not because it was better, because it
// was in the same ranked list. Separate sections dissolve exactly that — the same
// reason scope:'all' returns groups rather than one merged list.
//
// Design (b), shipped: the curated index built with the fixture present is
// bit-for-bit the control — corpusHash 56b48c09…, 122 docs, 1,586 chunks, all
// three unchanged — and the fixture's 15 documents are a 33-chunk index of their
// own. Re-runnable: MEMORY_EXTRA_PROJECT_DIRS=<fixture>/memory with
// MEMORY_PROJECT_CORPUS=curated reproduces the middle column.
//
// So: own index, own statistics, curated numbers bit-for-bit unchanged. What is
// DIFFERENT from the handoff corpus, and deliberate:
//   * HOT default tier. These are curated memories, not institutional history.
//   * WRITABLE. demote/promote work on them; they are real memories that a
//     future session may legitimately want to archive. Only the handoff corpus
//     is read-only.
//   * project + per-file account metadata carried, so both filters work.
//   * REACHED BY DEFAULT. The router widens to 'all' whenever a project corpus
//     exists (tools/memory.js), because a standing rule that needs an explicit
//     scope to be found is a standing rule nobody finds.

//     surface writes and reads as that account, or
//   * metadata.account in a memory's own frontmatter, which always wins.
// Unlabelled memories carry account: null and are returned by every query, so
// nothing existing disappears the day labelling is switched on.
// The signed-in account, read LIVE from ~/.claude.json. This is what makes
// automatic labelling possible at all: MCP hands the server no identity, and
// this Mac has ONE shared config per surface, so nothing static can distinguish
// two accounts. The oauth record does, because it reflects whoever is signed in
// at the moment the write happens.
// Transcripts were checked first and carry no account field, so this is the only

// ---- THE THIRD KIND OF ROOT: INSTITUTIONAL HANDOFF DOCUMENTS --------------
// The handoff documents are where a phase of work is written down for whoever
// picks it up next — the state of a campaign, what shipped, what is still open.
// They lived OUTSIDE both corpora, which meant no query could reach them: a
// session asking "what is the state of the corpus refresh" got the memory
// summary and never the handoff that holds the detail. Daniel approved indexing
// them (2026-08-19).
//
// THEY GET THEIR OWN INDEX, and that was MEASURED, not assumed. Curated
// inclusion was tried first (archive tier, so no hot boost, with
// RETRIEVAL.maxArchiveShare holding half the page). Over the 32 probes the
// handoff documents took ZERO top-3 slots — they crowded nothing out — and the
// benchmark still regressed:
//
//   metric                curated-only   +14 handoff docs in the curated index
//   MRR (24 ranked)          0.8194                 0.7986
//   absence verdict           4/4                    3/4     (X4 lost)
//   P2 paraphrase           rank 1                 rank 2
//
// The cause is not competition, it is SHARED STATISTICS. Several retrieval
// constants are derived from the corpus at load time, and the biggest is
// `referenceChunks` — the p90 of the chunk-count distribution, which the
// long-document correction shrinks against. Fourteen long documents moved it
// from 16 to 19, which quietly RAISED the dense score of every curated memory
// above 16 chunks. That pushed `deal-reg-email-rules` to 0.3842 against an
// absence scoreFloor of 0.38 — a 0.0042 margin — and the server stopped being
// able to say "I have no memory of a Postgres migration".
//
// This is the same lesson as staging (see stagingIndexPath below): a corpus with
// a different length and register cannot share another corpus's lexical
// statistics, however well-behaved its documents are in the ranking. So there
// are THREE indexes, each with its own statistics, and the curated numbers are
// bit-for-bit what they were.
//
// The other three properties:
//   * READ-ONLY. `readOnly: true` travels onto every doc, and doTier() refuses
//     to write to one. These files belong to other work; this server may read
//     them and nothing else. There is no MCP path that writes, demotes or
//     deletes them.
//   * ARCHIVE TIER. Kept even in their own index: within a handoff result page
//     it is neutral, and it means a future decision to blend them starts from
//     the conservative setting.
//   * MATCHED BY NAME. `match` restricts the root to the handoff patterns, so a
//     root directory that also holds unrelated .md files contributes only the
//     handoff documents.
// 2026-08-29: pre-registrations join the handoff corpus. They are the closest thing
// this project has to a written narrative — the bar, the controls, the numbers and the
// wrong turns, recorded BEFORE the outcome was known, so hindsight cannot rewrite them.
// 15 of them existed and NONE was reachable: they match no pattern above and live in
// `test/` dirs that were not roots. Daniel asked for opt-in prose linked to the
// important things; this is that, aimed at durable artifacts rather than transcripts,
// and it costs curated nothing because the handoff corpus is a separate index.
export const HANDOFF_PATTERNS = [/^HANDOFF.*\.md$/i, /^PHASE.*\.md$/i, /-HANDOFF.*\.md$/i,

// EMPTY BY DEFAULT, AND THAT IS THE FEATURE. The handoff corpus indexes documents
// that live OUTSIDE the memory folder, so its roots are a statement about one
// person's disk. Shipping anybody's actual directories as defaults would mean every
// other install carries a list that resolves to nothing — silently, since the
// existsSync filter below drops what is absent. Opt in with MEMORY_HANDOFF_DIRS
// (`:`-separated, or `;` on Windows); leave it unset and there is simply no handoff
// corpus, which costs the rest of the system nothing because it is a separate index.
//
// Two properties worth knowing before you add a root:
//   * THE SCAN IS FLAT, by design — a handoff one level below a listed root is not
//     found. Recursion would ingest handoff copies inside extracted zips and backups.
//     The orphan alarm warns about exactly that near-miss instead.
//   * ROOTS ARE MATCHED BY NAME (see `match` above), so a directory that also holds
//     unrelated .md files contributes only its handoff documents. That is what makes
//     listing something like a `test/` directory safe: it yields the
//     *-preregistration.md files and leaves the fixtures and answer keys beside them.

// even touch vibe-coding retrieval unless a search names it. The server has
// already measured what sharing an index costs, twice (staging: MRR 0.826 ->
// 0.681; handoff: 14 documents moved `referenceChunks` and broke an absence
// verdict on a 0.0042 margin), so the cure is the same as both times — own

// CATEGORIES:
//
//   <libraryBaseDir>/<category>/          (see libraryBaseDir below)

// zero code, zero risk to any other corpus, because per-corpus statistics are
// isolated BY CONSTRUCTION (bm25/referenceChunks/profile all derive inside
// loadScope from one index file).
//
// REACH ISOLATION is the half a separate index cannot give: `CORPORA` below
// stays THE WORK SET, `scope:'all'` expands to it and nothing else, and
// routeScope never returns a category. A category is searched ONLY when named
// (`scope:'books'`, `scope:['all','books']`) or via `scope:'everything'`.

// 5.73 -> 7.82 against an absFloor of 8.0: the margin that makes that constant
// mean anything went from 2.27 to 0.19.
//
// So the corpora get separate indexes and separate lexical statistics. This is
// the shape the Email Backup app already proves: 102k email vectors live in
// their own sidecar beside emails.db, never inside it.

// Two separate defects, and this fixes both: the search path now checks the
// corpus mtimes against the index BEFORE answering, and every response says
// when the index was built.
//

// MEASURED on this Mac, 122 curated files = 1.00 ms cold / 0.69 ms warm; the

  // matching every query term that exists in the corpus, at full tf.
  //
  // Each reference point is the LESSER of an absolute raw score and a share of
  // what this query can possibly achieve. The absolute half is what stops a
  // paraphrase from crowning an accidental match; the share half is what stops
  // a short exact query ("MEMORY", ideal 7.60) from being punished for having

  // score = max over chunks, and it has 517 chunks to this corpus's median of
  // 4. 517 draws from the same distribution produce a higher maximum than 4

  // keyword score of exactly 0 on most of them.
  //
  //   factor = (referenceChunks / nChunks) ** alpha        for nChunks > ref
  //
  // …applied to the semantic score only, and WAIVED in proportion to keyword
  // evidence: at kw >= keywordWaiver the document has concentrated lexical hits,
  // has already passed BM25's own length test, and keeps its full dense score.
  // That waiver is what keeps this a de-prioritisation rather than a ban —
  // "email backup app changelog" returns the changelog at rank 1, kw 1.0.
  //
  // referenceChunks is DERIVED per corpus at load time (p90 of the chunk-count

  // one of them (Postgres migration) scored 0.7518, higher than 20 of the 28
  // correct answers.
  //
  // THERE IS NO CLEAN SCORE THRESHOLD, and the numbers say so plainly: the
  // absent probes scored 0.19 / 0.42 / 0.53 / 0.75 while genuinely-correct
  // answers scored as low as 0.43 (E7) and 0.48 (P2). The distributions
  // overlap across their whole middle. So the verdict is not a score cut; it is
  // a conjunction of three independent weaknesses, each measured:
  //
  //   1. score       < scoreFloor        — nothing scored well, AND
  //   2. phrase      < phraseFloor       — the query's words never occur
  //                                        together anywhere, AND
  //   3. strictCoverage < coverageFloor  — raw BM25 / idealFull, i.e. how much
  //                                        of the question was answered ONCE
  //                                        the words that exist nowhere in the

  //                                        remainder matches something well.

// phraseFloor cannot move either: the Kubernetes (0.25) and Postgres (0.2963)
// refusals both route through byVocabulary and need it above ~0.30.
//
// Semantics DO mostly discriminate -- but not reliably, and that is why no
// absence route reads a semantic score directly. Measured over 12 queries:
// absent 0.358-0.644, present 0.710-1.000, cleanly separated. Then the case
// that matters: absent "Kubernetes" scores 0.7719, which lands INSIDE the
// present range and above the present price-book case at 0.7103. So a floor
// would hold for most queries and fail unpredictably for some -- an embedding
// always has a nearest neighbour and always reports a respectable similarity
// to it. Every signal both routes read is lexical or fused, deliberately.
//
// The actual cause is a synonym gap -- the query says "end-of-life", the memory
// says "EOL" -- so the honest fixes are a real synonym/acronym layer (derived,
// never hand-written; the vocabulary trap has failed three times in this repo)
// or nothing. Adding "end-of-life" to that memory would fix the number and
// contaminate the benchmark, which is separately documented in test/run-tests.js.

// ---- WHERE A QUERY CAME FROM, AND WHY `live` MUST BE EARNED ----------------
//
// The log defaulted to `src: 'live'`, so anything calling lib/search.js directly
// was indistinguishable from a person asking a question. Measured 2026-08-25:
// 7,953 rows tagged `live` in one day across just 99 DISTINCT queries -- the gold
// set, run ~150x each by ~15 suite runs. Six were real.
//
// That is not merely noisy telemetry. dream's `write-description` queue is ORDERED
// BY RETRIEVAL COUNT, so it was prioritising whatever the benchmark hits most:
// "MEMORY retrieved 1875x", and an exchange from the session that was running the
// tests at "600x". The queue meant to say what Daniel needs described was ranked
// by what the test harness happened to ask.
//
// So `live` is now a CLAIM THAT MUST BE EARNED: only a real MCP tool invocation
// sets it (tools/memory.js, inside the server.tool callback, which is reached from
// index.js and nowhere else). Everything else logs `unknown` -- honest about not
// knowing, rather than confidently wrong. An explicit MEMORY_QUERY_SOURCE still
// wins, which is how verify-stdio marks its own synthetic traffic.

// D4: suite group (a46) asserted "no row from THIS run is tagged live" by
// filtering the shared append-only log on `ts >= suiteStart`. That is a WALL
// CLOCK WINDOW over a file other processes append to, so a person using Claude
// normally while the suite ran turned their own correctly-tagged `live` rows
// into a suite failure: 896/1, the named queries never issued by the suite.
// A row now carries the id of the process that wrote it, and assertions filter
// on that instead of on time.
