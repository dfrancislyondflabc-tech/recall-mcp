//   node scripts/dream.js [--apply] [--force] [--limit N]
//
// Default is a dry report. --apply performs ONLY the two mechanical, reversible
// operations (stamp curatedHash, demote a superseded doc). It never deletes,
// never edits a body, and never removes a credential on its own.
//
// ── THE GATE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Conjunctive, not periodic: fire on ACCUMULATED SIGNAL, not the clock, so a
// quiet week costs nothing and a busy day is not consolidated five times.
// (Shape borrowed from Claude Code's own dream consolidation, which gates on
// minHours AND minSessions. The constants there suit a small hand-written
// corpus; auto-ingest grows orders of magnitude faster, so ours are settings
// and the right values should be MEASURED the way the retrieval constants were,
// not inherited.)
//
// ── WHY A QUEUE AND NOT A REWRITE ──────────────────────────────────────────
// Measured 2026-08-17: rewriting all 101 descriptions by hand is worth about
// two rank-1 positions. Curation is low-yield PER DOCUMENT, so a pass that
// walks the corpus spends nearly all of its effort on memories nobody ever
// retrieves. The query log (lib/search.js logQuery) is what makes the
// difference: it says which documents are actually being asked for, and which
// of those are ranking badly. That is the only defensible way to aim a pass
// that costs tokens.
//
// ── SUPERSESSION, WHICH IS THE PART WORTH HAVING ───────────────────────────
// A correction and a changed fact look identical in text, and embeddings encode
// topic rather than truth-direction: "30+ agents caused it" and "5 agents, never
// more than 2" are NEAR NEIGHBOURS, not opposites. So detection here is
// retrieval-based and deliberately advisory — a staged exchange whose nearest
// neighbour is an OLDER document on the same subject is a CANDIDATE, queued for
// a human or a model to adjudicate. It is never auto-resolved.
// When it is resolved, the loser is DEMOTED, not deleted: `supersededBy` in
// frontmatter and archive tier, so search returns the current fact while
// neighbors can still reach the superseded one. Destructive overwrite loses
// that history; this does not.

// (b) SUPERSESSION — OFF BY DEFAULT, RUNNING IN SHADOW.
//
// MEASURED 2026-08-18 on the real corpus: 20 candidates, ZERO true positives.
// Every one was a correction phrase paired with a memory that never asserted the
// thing being corrected. Two of the twenty touched a memory that DID contain the
// relevant claim, and in both the memory was right and the correction was of
// something I had said — the opposite of a supersession.
//
// The cause is structural, not a tuning miss: SIMILARITY FINDS TOPIC, and a
// correction is about a CLAIM. In a long exchange those come apart constantly —
// "I was wrong" about one thing, dominant topic another, pairing made on topic.
//
// So the arm no longer feeds the queue. It runs in SHADOW: every candidate is
// written to .supersession-shadow.jsonl with its evidence, so the idea can be
// evaluated over real traffic without spending anyone's attention. Precedent is
// this project's own — answer-coverage ships its chain arm OFF because it
// covered 15 confirmed misses.
//
// TURNED ON 2026-08-18, on the evidence below. It shipped OFF and spent its
// time in shadow; the full-corpus evaluation (--shadow-all over 2,027 staged
// exchanges) is what earned it the switch:
//     20 candidates / 0 genuine   -> the version that shipped off
//     24 candidates / 6 genuine   -> first-person retractions only
// Of those six, four are worth a human, one names a memory that already
// records the correction, and one is a containment miss. A modest, known
// error rate on a six-item queue.
// Shadow logging CONTINUES while it is on, so the evidence keeps accruing and
// the decision stays reversible on data rather than memory.
//   DREAM_SUPERSESSION=off     do not compute it at all
//   DREAM_SUPERSESSION=shadow  compute + log, never queue
//   DREAM_SUPERSESSION=on      compute + log + QUEUE            (default)
// Only phrases that assert a PRIOR CLAIM IS WRONG. Measured against the 2,014
// staged exchanges: an earlier, looser list (actually / in fact / rather than /
// instead of) fired on 76% OF EVERY EXCHANGE, because those describe a choice or
// are discourse filler. This one fires on 15%.
// MEASURED TWICE. The first list fired on 76% of every exchange. The second
// still produced 20 candidates and 0 true positives, and the shadow log shows
// why: "is wrong" and "contradicts" attach to THINGS, not to claims — "your
// token is wrong", "the flag is wrong", "the quote is WRONG without sales tax".
// None of those retracts a statement; they assert one.
// A supersession needs someone to withdraw a PRIOR CLAIM, so the phrase must
// bind to a speaker or a statement.
// FIRST-PERSON RETRACTIONS ONLY. Measured over all 2,027 staged exchanges
// (--shadow-all), because the incremental run was scoring 43 documents and its
// zero meant nothing. 38 raw candidates, 13 passed containment, and reading all
// 13 split them cleanly:
//   4  first-person retractions   -- every one a genuine withdrawn claim
//   9  concessions and word-sense -- "you were right to ask", "you were right on
//      both counts, and both are now committed", and "superseded by" describing
//      a FILE that was deleted rather than a claim that was retracted.
