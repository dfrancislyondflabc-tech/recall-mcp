// scripts/commit-memories.js — give the curated memories a history.
//
// The memory folder held 132 hand-written memories and NO version control, so a
// bad overwrite was unrecoverable. The evidence that this hurt was already sitting
// in the folder: two hand-made backups (`.bak`, `.backup-pre-scrub`) that someone
// created because there was no other way to undo a change.
//
// LOCAL ONLY, AND DELIBERATELY SO. A memory corpus accumulates credentials --
// an SSH password pasted into a note, a token in a runbook. On disk that is a
// fact you can still fix; in a pushed git
// history it would be permanent and off-machine, surviving any later deletion
// unless the history were rewritten. So this script never adds a remote and never
// pushes, and it refuses to run if someone else adds one while secrets are still
// present. History for recovery is the goal; offsite replication is a separate
// decision that needs the credentials dealt with first.
//
// Runs from the Stop hook: at most one commit per turn, and only when something
// actually changed. It must NEVER break the hook, so every path exits 0.
//
// 🟥 A DELETED MEMORY IS HELD BACK, NOT COMMITTED. Staging used to be a bare `git add -A`,
// which stages deletions — so an accidental removal was committed by this very hook within
// the same turn and left HEAD. History still held it, but nothing said so. A deleted *.md is
// now un-staged again and reported loudly; it stays in HEAD, so recovery is one command.
// `--accept-deletions` commits them deliberately. See MCP-MEMORY-PROBLEMS-AND-FIXES.md MEM-6.

  // This script used to stage with a bare `git add -A`, which stages DELETIONS. The sequence

  // within the same turn -> the deletion is committed -> the file leaves HEAD. History still
  // held it, but nothing said so, and finding it again needed `git log --diff-filter=D`.
  // The snapshot system FAITHFULLY RECORDED THE LOSS instead of resisting it.
  //
  // Now: everything else is staged as before, and a deleted *.md is un-staged again, so the
  // file stays in HEAD and recovery is one obvious command. The deletion remains visible in
  // `git status`, so this warns every turn until a human resolves it — which is the point,
  // and why `--accept-deletions` has to exist. A guard with no cheap way to say "yes, I meant
  // it" is a guard that gets deleted; Claude's own memory guidance says to remove memories
