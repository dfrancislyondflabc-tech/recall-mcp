//
// WHY A HOOK AND NOT A CONVENTION. Auto-captured exchanges are stamped by the
// extractor, because the extractor writes them. CURATED memories are written by
// Claude with an ordinary file tool that never goes through this server, so
// nothing stamps those — the label depended on whoever was writing remembering
// to add it, and a rule that depends on remembering is a rule that decays.
//
// Only ever ADDS. If a memory already names an account that stands, including
// when it names a different one: re-attributing somebody else's memory to
// whoever happens to edit it next is the exact "attribution follows the reader"
// mistake this field exists to avoid.
//
// Silent and non-fatal by design: it runs on every memory write, and a stamping
// failure must never be able to lose the memory itself.

 * 🟥 WHY THIS FIELD EXISTS. A directive given to ONE session — roughly "use the memory server to
 * help you with the job in front of you; if you find problems in it, just log them and carry on" —
 * was captured as a STANDING RULE. A later session that had been pointed AT the memory server read
 * it and refused to do the work it had just been asked for. Nothing in the memory recorded who the
 * instruction was aimed at, so every future reader inherited it as universal.
 *
 * A session TITLE was considered and measured: it is only joinable for 74 of 115 memories, and it
 * describes a session's FIRST message — useless on a 776-exchange session where the rule was
 * captured at exchange 500. The last user message before the write is the actual context, and it
 * is available here for free.
 *
 * Reads only the TAIL of the transcript: these files reach 11 MB, and this runs on every memory
 * write. Redacted through the same guard as everything else, and truncated — this is a label, not
 * a record.
