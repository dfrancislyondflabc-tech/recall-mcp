// scripts/measure-index-memory.js — what an index actually costs to hold.
//
//   node scripts/measure-index-memory.js [curated|staging|handoff|<path>] ...
//
// READ-ONLY. It never writes an index, a cache, or anything else.
//
// WHY IT FORKS. Node reports memory for the whole process, so measuring three representations in
// one process measures the high-water mark of all three plus whatever the harness left behind.
// Each (index x representation) pair therefore gets a fresh child that does one thing and exits.
//
// 🟥 THE METHODOLOGY RULE, and the reason this file exists at all. The figure that started this
// work — "about 45 KB per chunk for a 3 KB vector" — was WRONG, by roughly 4.3x. It came from
// reading `heapUsed` immediately after `JSON.parse`, while the parse's own garbage was still
// live. The same object graph settles to a quarter of that a few seconds later.
//
// So: never sample straight after a parse. Sample after >= 6 s of 1 Hz global.gc(), and report
// the PEAK separately via process.resourceUsage().maxRSS. They answer different questions —
// "how much does holding this cost" versus "how much headroom does loading it need" — and this
// change improves them by very different amounts, so reporting one alone misleads.
